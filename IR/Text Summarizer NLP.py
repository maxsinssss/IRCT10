text = """Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humanâ€“computer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve natural language understanding, natural language generation, and machine learning. Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source (text) to produce an abridged version for a particular user or task. Automatic text summarization methods are greatly needed to address the ever-growing amount of text data available online to both better help discover relevant information and to consume the vast amount of text data available more efficiently."""
